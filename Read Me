Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The application needed to be able to have a user login with an email and password. They should be able to enter or create an acount. They should be taken to a screen that displays their goal weight. A table that shows 
multiple dates displaying their weight for that day. The app should give the option to send SMS messages.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I enjoy my layout. It is a cookie cutter simple application. There is no originality to the UI and everyone will understand how to use it based off experience from other applications.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I used decision making and testing to create a functional application that is simple to vavigate.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I ran the de-bug option and built the project in Android Studio
Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I needed to create a way to have the user input information and press the correct buttons to make an application that functions as needed.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
My UI knowledge shines. My programming shows correct formatting and understanding of classes and data flow.
